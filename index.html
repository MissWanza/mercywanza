     Introduction to CSS basics
    </H1>
    <p> CSS <em>(Cascading Style Sheet)</em> is the code that styles web content and like HTML, CSS is not a programming language. It's not a markup language either. </p>

CSS is a <strong>style sheet language</strong> that selectively styles HTML elements. It describes how the HTML elements are displayed on screen, paper, or in other media.

  CSS is used to define styles for your web pages, including the design, layout and variations in display for different devices and screen sizes.

  The Anatomy of a CSS ruleset
</H2>
<img src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/CSS_basics/css-declaration-small.png" alt="The Anatomy of a CSS ruleset" width="480"/> 

<p>
  The whole structure is called a ruleset often referred to as just rule. Here are the individual parts of the CSS Rule:
</p>
<ol>
  <li> <em><strong>Selector:</strong></em> This is the HTML element name at the start of the ruleset. It defines the element(s) to be styled. </li>
  <li> <em><strong>Declaration:</strong></em>This is a single rule like color. It specifies which of the element's properties you want to style.</li>
  <li> <em><strong>Properties:</strong></em> These are ways in which you can style an HTML element. (In this example, color is a property of the elements.) In CSS, you choose which properties you want to affect in the rule. </li>
  <li> <em><strong> Property value:</strong></em> To the right of the property—after the colon—there is the property value. This chooses one out of many possible appearances for a given property. </li>
</ol>

  To Note
</h2>
<p>
Here are other important parts of the syntax:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Apart from the selector, each ruleset must be wrapped in curly braces. ({})</li>
  <li>Within each declaration, you must use a colon (:) to separate the property from its value or values.</li>
  <li>Within each ruleset, you must use a semicolon (;) to separate each declaration from the next one.</li>
</ul>
